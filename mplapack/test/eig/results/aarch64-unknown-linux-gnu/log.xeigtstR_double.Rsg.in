 Tests of the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5
    N:         0     1     2     3     5
    NB:        1     3    20
    NBMIN:     2     2     2
    NX:        1     1     1
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+2.2250738585072014e-308
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+1.7976931348623157e+308
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+1.1102230246251565e-16

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+2.0000000000000000e+01



 DSG:  NB =   1, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DSG passed the threshold (  7980 tests run)


 DSG:  NB =   3, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DSG passed the threshold (  7980 tests run)


 DSG:  NB =  20, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DSG passed the threshold (  7980 tests run)
