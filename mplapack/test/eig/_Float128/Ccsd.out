 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+3.3621031431120935e-4932
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+1.1897314953572318e+4932
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+1.9259299443872359e-34

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+3.0000000000000000e+01

 CSD: CS Decomposition
 Matrix types: 
    1: Random orthogonal matrix (Haar measure)
    2: Nearly orthogonal matrix with uniformly distributed angles atan2( S, C ) in CS decomposition
    3: Random orthogonal matrix with clustered angles atan2( S, C ) in CS decomposition
 Test ratios: 
   2-by-2 CSD
    1: norm( U1' * X11 * V1 - C ) / ( max(  P,  Q) * max(norm(I-X'*X),EPS) )
