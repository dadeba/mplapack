    NX:        1     0     5     9     1
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+9.5302596195518043e-323228497
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+2.0985787164673877e+323228496
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+7.4583407312002067e-155

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+5.0000000000000000e+01

 RST routines passed the tests of the error exits (209 tests done)


 SE2:  NB =   1, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DST passed the threshold (  4440 tests run)
