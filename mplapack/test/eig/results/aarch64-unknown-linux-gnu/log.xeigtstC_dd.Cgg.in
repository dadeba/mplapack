 Tests of the Generalized Nonsymmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    NB:        1     1     2     2
    NBMIN:    40    40     2     2
    NS:        2     4     2     4
    MAXB:     40    40     2     2
    IACC22:      1     2     1     2
    NBCOL:    40    40     2     2
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be2.0041683600089728e-292
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be1.7976931348623158e+308
 Relative machine precision is taken to be4.9303806576313200e-32

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than2.0000000000000000e+01

 ZGG routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 36 tests done)


 ZGG:  NB =   1, NBMIN =  40, NS =   2, MAXB =  40, IACC22 =   1, NBCOL =  40

 All tests for ZGG passed the threshold (  2184 tests run)
