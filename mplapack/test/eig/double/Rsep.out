 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:

    NBMIN:     2     2     2     2     2
    NX:        1     0     5     9     1
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+2.2250738585072014e-308

 DST -- Real Symmetric eigenvalue problem
 Matrix types (see xDRVST for details): 

 Special Matrices:
  1=Zero matrix.                          5=Diagonal: clustered entries.
  2=Identity matrix.                      6=Diagonal: large, evenly spaced.
  3=Diagonal: evenly spaced entries.      7=Diagonal: small, evenly spaced.
  4=Diagonal: geometr. spaced entries.
 Dense Symmetric Matrices:
  8=Evenly spaced eigenvals.             12=Small, evenly spaced eigenvals.
  9=Geometrically spaced eigenvals.      13=Matrix with random O(1) entries.
 10=Clustered eigenvalues.               14=Matrix with large random entries.
 11=Large, evenly spaced eigenvals.      15=Matrix with small random entries.
