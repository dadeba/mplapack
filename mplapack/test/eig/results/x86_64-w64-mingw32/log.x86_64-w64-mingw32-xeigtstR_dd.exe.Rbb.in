 Tests of Rgbbrd
 (reduction of a general band matrix to real bidiagonal form)
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be2.0041683600089728e-292
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be1.7976931348623158e+308
 Relative machine precision is taken to be4.9303806576313200e-32

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than2.0000000000000000e+01



 DBB:  NRHS =   1

 All tests for DBB passed the threshold (  3000 tests run)


 DBB:  NRHS =   2

 All tests for DBB passed the threshold (  3000 tests run)
