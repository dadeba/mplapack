
 Tests of the Linear Least Squares routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         6     0     5     8    10    30
    P:         0     5     5     5     8    20
    N:         5     5     6     8    12    40
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be1.6259745436952323e-260
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be1.7976931348623158e+308
 Relative machine precision is taken to be1.2154326714572501e-63

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than2.0000000000000000e+01

 LSE routines passed the tests of the error exits (  8 tests done)

 All tests for LSE routines passed the threshold (     96 tests run)


 End of tests
 Total time used =         1.00 seconds
