 Tests of the Generalized QR and RQ routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     3    10
    P:         0     5    20
    N:         0     3    30
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+3.3621031431120935e-4932
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+1.1897314953572318e+4932
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+5.4210108624275222e-20

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+2.0000000000000000e+01

 GQR routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 12 tests done)

 All tests for GQR routines passed the threshold (   1728 tests run)
