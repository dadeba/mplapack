 Tests of the CS Decomposition routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:

               8    20
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+9.5302596195518043e-323228497
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+2.0985787164673877e+323228496
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+7.4583407312002067e-155

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+3.0000000000000000e+01

 CSD routines passed the tests of the error exits (  8 tests done)

 All tests for CSD routines passed the threshold (    720 tests run)
