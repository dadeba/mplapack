 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on the original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
        M  :     0     1     2     3     5    10    50
        N  :     0     1     2     3     5    10    50
     NRHS  :     1     2    15
       NB  :     1     3     3     3    20
       NX  :     1     0     5     9     1
     RANK  :    30    50    90

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   60.00

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be : +3.3621031431120935e-4932

 CPT:  Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal
 Matrix types (1-6 have specified condition numbers):
    1. Diagonal                        7. Random, unspecified CNDNUM
    2. Random, CNDNUM = 2              8. First row and column zero
    3. Random, CNDNUM = sqrt(0.1/EPS)  9. Last row and column zero
    4. Random, CNDNUM = 0.1/EPS       10. Middle row and column zero
    5. Scaled near underflow          11. Scaled near underflow
    6. Scaled near overflow           12. Scaled near overflow
 Test ratios:
    1: norm( U'*D*U - A ) / ( N * norm(A) * EPS ), or
       norm( L*D*L' - A ) / ( N * norm(A) * EPS )
    2: norm( B - A * X )  / ( norm(A) * norm(X) * EPS )
    3: norm( X - XACT )   / ( norm(XACT) * CNDNUM * EPS )
    4: norm( X - XACT )   / ( norm(XACT) * CNDNUM * EPS ), refined
    5: norm( X - XACT )   / ( norm(XACT) * (error bound) )
    6: (backward error)   / EPS
    7: RCOND * CNDNUM - 1.0
