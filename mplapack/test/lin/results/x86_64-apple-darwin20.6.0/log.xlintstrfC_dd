 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
        N  :     0     1     2     3     5     6    10    11    50
     NRHS  :     1     2    15
        M  :     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   30.00

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be : 2.0041683600089728e-292
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be : 1.7976931348623158e+308
 Relative machine precision is taken to be : 4.9303806576313200e-32
