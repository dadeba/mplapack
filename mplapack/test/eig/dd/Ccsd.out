 CSD: CS Decomposition
 Matrix types: 
    1: Random orthogonal matrix (Haar measure)
    2: Nearly orthogonal matrix with uniformly distributed angles atan2( S, C ) in CS decomposition
    3: Random orthogonal matrix with clustered angles atan2( S, C ) in CS decomposition
 Test ratios: 
   2-by-2 CSD
    1: norm( U1' * X11 * V1 - C ) / ( max(  P,  Q) * max(norm(I-X'*X),EPS) )
