 Tests of the CS Decomposition routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1    10    10    10    10    21    24    30    22
              32    55
    P:         0     1     4     4     0    10     9    10    20    12
              12    40
    N:         0     1     0    10     4     4    15    12     8    20
               8    20
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be2.0041683600089728e-292
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be1.7976931348623158e+308
 Relative machine precision is taken to be4.9303806576313200e-32

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than3.0000000000000000e+01

 CSD routines passed the tests of the error exits (  8 tests done)

 All tests for CSD routines passed the threshold (    720 tests run)
