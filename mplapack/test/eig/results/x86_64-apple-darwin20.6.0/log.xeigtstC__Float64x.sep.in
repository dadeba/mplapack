 Tests of the Hermitian Eigenvalue Problem routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    25
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    25

    NX:        1     0     5     9     1
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+3.3621031431120935e-4932
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+1.1897314953572318e+4932
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+5.4210108624275222e-20

 ZST -- Complex Hermitian eigenvalue problem
 Matrix types (see Cchkst for details): 

 Special Matrices:
  1=Zero matrix.                          5=Diagonal: clustered entries.
  2=Identity matrix.                      6=Diagonal: large, evenly spaced.
  3=Diagonal: evenly spaced entries.      7=Diagonal: small, evenly spaced.
  4=Diagonal: geometr. spaced entries.
 Dense Hermitian Matrices:
  8=Evenly spaced eigenvals.             12=Small, evenly spaced eigenvals.
  9=Geometrically spaced eigenvals.      13=Matrix with random O(1) entries.
 10=Clustered eigenvalues.               14=Matrix with large random entries.
 11=Large, evenly spaced eigenvals.      15=Matrix with small random entries.
 16=Positive definite, evenly spaced eigenvalues
 17=Positive definite, geometrically spaced eigenvlaues
 18=Positive definite, clustered eigenvalues
 19=Positive definite, small evenly spaced eigenvalues
 20=Positive definite, large evenly spaced eigenvalues
 21=Diagonally dominant tridiagonal, geometrically spaced eigenvalues
