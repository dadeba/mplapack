 Tests of the Generalized Linear Regression Model routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     5     8    15    20    40
    P:         9     0    15    12    15    30
    N:         5     5    10    25    30    40
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+9.5302596195518043e-323228497
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+2.0985787164673877e+323228496
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+7.4583407312002067e-155

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+2.0000000000000000e+01

 GLM routines passed the tests of the error exits (  8 tests done)

 All tests for GLM routines passed the threshold (     48 tests run)
