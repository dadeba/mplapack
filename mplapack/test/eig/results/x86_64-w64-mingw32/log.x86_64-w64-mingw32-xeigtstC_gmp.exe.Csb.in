 Tests of Chbtrd
 (reduction of a Hermitian band matrix to real tridiagonal form)
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         5    20
    N:         5    20
    K:         0     1     2     5    16
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+6.4447927660133239e-1292913987
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+1.5516402719316431e+1292913986
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+7.4583407312002067e-155

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+2.0000000000000000e+01

 ZHB routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 80 tests done)
