 Tests of Rsbtrd
 (reduction of a symmetric band matrix to tridiagonal form)
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         5    20
    N:         5    20
    K:         0     1     2     5    16
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+9.5302596195518043e-323228497
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+2.0985787164673877e+323228496
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+7.4583407312002067e-155

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+2.0000000000000000e+01

 DSB routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 75 tests done)

 All tests for DSB passed the threshold (   810 tests run)
